I am an AI/ML Engineer focused on building learning-based imaging and intelligent engineering systems. My work centers on lensless image reconstruction, end-to-end machine learning pipelines, and MLOps-oriented infrastructure for training, deployment, and monitoring. I also have hands-on experience in firmware development and AI-driven circuit design automation, enabling tight integration between machine learning models, hardware, and embedded systems. I am particularly interested in bridging research and practical engineering by turning experimental ideas into reliable, scalable systems across imaging, hardware, and robotics.
